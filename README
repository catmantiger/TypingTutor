Howto use TypingTutor
=====================

Once shared libraries copied to plugins directory, you will see 'TypingTutor'
plugin listed in gedit's 'preferences->plugins' window. Enabling the plugin
will add 'TypingTutor' to gedit's 'Tools' menu.

Open one training text file for your language in gedit, or create a new one.
Click, 'Tools -> TypingTutor', you will see a new window with the training
training text file on top text area and an empty text area in bottom, right
click on the bottom text area and choose preferred input method for your
language.

Click 'Start timer' and start typing in the bottom text area, whenever a
character entered, it will be compared with the top text area's character
which is present in the same location, if both characters are not equal, then
the entered character will be marked in red, and 'Mistake key' will be
incremented one. Once finish, click 'Stop timer', and you will see details
like how long you typed, how many mistakes happened and how many keystrokes
entered.

Future Additions
================

At present, 'Elapsed time' details will be updated only when we enter a
character, in future, it should be updated automatically without entering
a keystroke.

Adding 'words per minute', 'accuracy percentage' in details tab will he helpful
for the trainers.

Need to show keyboard layout image for the selected language at the bottom
of TypingTutor window. gedit supports lot of languages, collecting layout
images for all languages is a big task.
